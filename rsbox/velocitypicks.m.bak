% VELOCITYPICKS - script containing velocity picks for selected CMPs.
%
% Each CMP must contain the same number of picks, five will generally do.
% For times smaller than the first time-pick or larger than the last 
% time-pick, the velocity is assumed constant.
%
% cmppos - CMP position [m]
% v      - NMO velocity [m/s]
% t      - time of picked NMO velocity [ms]

% Given numbers are just examples.
% Times and CMP numbers have to be in ascending order.
% Matrices t and v have to be square: this means that if you did not take the 
%  same amount of velocity-time picks for all CMPs, you will have to copy 
%  velocities from your first timepick to earlier time(s), for those CMPs which
%  have fewer picks than the others (hereby assuming the velocity in the 
%  overburden stays constant).
